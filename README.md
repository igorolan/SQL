The Northwind Database
The Northwind database is a sample database used by Microsoft to demonstrate the features of some of its products, including SQL Server and Microsoft Access. The database contains the sales data for Northwind Traders, a fictitious specialty foods exportÂ­import company.

Although the code taught in this class is not specific to Microsoft products, we use the Northwind database for many of our examples because many people are already familiar with it and because there are many resources for related learning that make use of the same database.
